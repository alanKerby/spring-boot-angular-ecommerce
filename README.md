# Ecommerce Demo Project
## What is the project?

The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to develop a Spring Boot application programming interface (API) with create/read/update/delete (CRUD) functionality with an Angular framework frontend and mySQL database. Postman can be used to utilise CRUD functionality. All products in the database are displayed on the homepage, clicking a product navigates to the product page, products can be added to the basket up to the stock limit.



Usage
Below are screenshots of Postman and MySQL to demonstrate CRUD functionality.
